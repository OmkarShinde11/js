console.log(b);
console.log(a);
let a=8;
var b=7;
//here we get a error for let not for var 
//  in memory execution var is in global scope with undefined in it and let is stored in other memory with undeined so in var undefined is print but i let undefined is not print still it's there in memory so in this let and const scenario the let and const are not acess untill it's initialize a value.

//let and const are temporered dead zone.
// temporered dead zone nothing but time which variable are hoisted and assign a value in between the time which is called teporered dead zone time.
